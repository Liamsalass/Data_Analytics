    "Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables. It has a value between +1 and -1, where +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and -1 is total negative linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the provided code, the Pearson's correlation is being used to measure the relationship between the year a house was built ('YEAR BUILT') and its sale price ('SALE PRICE').\n",

    "If the correlation coefficient is close to +1, it would mean that there's a strong positive relationship between the year a house was built and its price, i.e., newer houses tend to be more expensive. If it's close to -1, it would mean there's a strong negative relationship, i.e., older houses tend to be more expensive. If it's close to 0, it would mean that there's no significant linear relationship between the year a house was built and its price.\n",

    "From my tests, the results concluded that most types of condos had the least amount of variance while luxury hotles and warehouses had the most variance.

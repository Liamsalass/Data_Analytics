### Q2
My gpt chat for [Question 2]

My chat with copilot:
Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables. It has a value between +1 and -1, where +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and -1 is total negative linear correlation.

In the context of the provided code, the Pearson's correlation is being used to measure the relationship between the year a house was built ('YEAR BUILT') and its sale price ('SALE PRICE').

If the correlation coefficient is close to +1, it would mean that there's a strong positive relationship between the year a house was built and its price, i.e., newer houses tend to be more expensive. If it's close to -1, it would mean there's a strong negative relationship, i.e., older houses tend to be more expensive. If it's close to 0, it would mean that there's no significant linear relationship between the year a house was built and its price.
